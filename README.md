</div>

<p>A fork of <a href="https://github.com/borgCode/TarnishedTool">Tarnished Tool</a> by borgCode, tailored for speedrun session workflow. Adds clean session management (Detach), richer in-game hotkey feedback, and quality-of-life improvements for runners.</p>

[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/karlittoSR/TarnishedTool.svg)](https://github.com/karlittoSR/TarnishedTool/releases/latest)

**This tool is strictly for offline use only, it directly manipulates game memory which violates the Terms of Service and will most likely lead to a ban if you use this online.**

*When attached, the loading screen title in game changes to "TarnishedTool - Speedrun Edition".*

## Changelog

### v1.1.1
* **Change Runes** — replaced "Give Runes" with an exact-set mechanic: the value you type becomes your exact rune count. Clamped to `0 – 999,999,999`. Negative values are rejected by the UI.
* **No-Clip default speed** — no-clip now starts at speed `3` instead of `1` for more practical out-of-the-box use.
* **Draw Stable Position** — new toggle under Utility → Rendering. Enables the in-game stable-position indicator (ported from veeenu's practice tool). Bindable to a hotkey, shows ON/OFF toast notification.
* **IGT Overlay** — new "Show IGT" checkbox under Utility → General. Opens a draggable, always-on-top transparent overlay showing the current In-Game Time (`IGT HH:MM:SS.cs`). Updates every 16 ms (1-frame precision at 60 fps). Position is saved between sessions.
* **Check for Updates** — the update button now points to this fork's releases (`karlittoSR/TarnishedTool`) instead of the original upstream repo.

### v1.1.0
* **Detach button** — resets all active toggles, uninstalls all hooks, frees the code cave and releases the game process in one click, leaving the game in a vanilla state ready for a run.
* The Detach button is only enabled when the player is **in-world** (prevents crashes from null pointers on the main menu).
* **Closing the tool** (red X / Alt+F4) automatically performs the same cleanup — no manual detach needed.
* **Hotkey notifications** — every hotkey now shows an **ON / OFF toast notification** (green / red). Only one toast on screen at a time; latest always replaces the previous. ON by default.
* All notification labels use human-readable names.
* **Blue theme** — replaced the original orange/amber palette with a blue speedrun-focused palette.
* **Loading screen text** changed to `TarnishedTool - Speedrun Edition`.
* Fixed loading screen reminder text showing vanilla FMG text appended after the custom string (missing UTF-16LE null terminator).
* Fixed reminder text not appearing when no player flags were active.
* Fixed a crash when detaching on the main menu (null pointer writes now silently skip).
* Fixed player speed toggle setting speed to `0` when no previous speed was remembered.

## Speedrun Edition — Features

### Clean Session Management (Detach)
* **Detach button** — resets all active toggles, uninstalls all hooks, frees the code cave and releases the game process in one click, leaving the game in a vanilla state ready for a run.
* The Detach button is only enabled when the player is **in-world** (prevents crashes from null pointers on the main menu).
* **Closing the tool** (red X / Alt+F4) automatically performs the same cleanup — no manual detach needed.

### Hotkey Notifications
* Every hotkey now shows an **ON / OFF toast notification** (green / red) instead of a generic one-shot popup.
* All notification labels use human-readable names (no raw enum names).
* Only one toast is on screen at a time — the latest one always replaces the previous.
* Notifications are **ON by default**.

### IGT Overlay
* Toggle **Show IGT** in the Utility tab to open a draggable transparent overlay showing current In-Game Time.
* Updates every 16 ms (1-frame precision at 60 fps).
* Overlay position is saved between sessions — drag it wherever you want it.

### Other Additions
* **Change Runes** — set your exact rune count directly (clamped to valid game range).
* **Draw Stable Position** — rendering toggle to display the player's stable position indicator in-game, bindable to a hotkey.
* **No-Clip** now defaults to speed `3`.
